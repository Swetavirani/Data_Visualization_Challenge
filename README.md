# Data_Visualization_Challenge

- Checking the number of mice
- Getting the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint.
- Get all the data for the duplicate mouse ID. 
- Create a clean DataFrame by dropping the duplicate mouse by its ID
- Checking the number of mice in the clean DataFrame.
- Generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen
- Generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen
- Generate a bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using Pandas.
- Generate a bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using pyplot
- Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas
- Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot
- Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
- Put treatments into a list for for loop (and later for plot labels)
- Generate a box plot that shows the distrubution of the tumor volume for each treatment group.
- Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin
- Generate a scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen
- Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen
